# VTT
:warning: **W.I.P** :warning:

Pure-JavaScript implementations of various subtitle formats.
Started life as a script to correct badly-synced `*.srt` files.

This library will (eventually) be a collection of classes for
parsing subtitle formats, with ancillary executables to perform
basic, in-place modification of subtitle files from command-line.

Check back later.
